    <p>
     gDesklets provides an advanced architecture for desktop applets -
     tiny displays that sit on your desktop such as status meters, icon
     bars, weather sensors, news tickers.
    </p>
    <p>
     gDesklets is a system for bringing mini programs (desklets), such as
     weather forecasts, news tickers, system information displays, or music
     player controls, onto your desktop, where they are sitting there in a
     symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness. The possibilities are
     really endless and they are always there to serve you whenever you need
     them, just one key-press away. The system is not restricted to one desktop
     environment, but currently works on most of the modern Unix desktops
     (including GNOME, KDE, Xfce).

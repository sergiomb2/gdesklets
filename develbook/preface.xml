  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>Any good development platform is worthless without documentation.
    This book attempts to explain the <application>gDesklets</application>
    platform in detail, and is designed for developers who wish to create
    their own applets.</para>

  <para>Due to the nature of an evolving project, a documentation book will
    always be a work-in-progress. This book will continually be revised and
    extended to reflect the latest state of the
    <application>gDesklets</application> development platform.
    Any suggestions or help from the readers is highly appreciated, and
    would greatly aid to make this book a comprehensive and up-to-date
    source of information for applet developers.</para>

  <para>If you find some passages to be hard to read or totally incomprehensible,
    please do not curse about them. Instead, let us know what's bad. That way
    you can help us to make it better.</para>

  <para>Now let's start with the documentation. We wish you will have as much
    fun developing on the <application>gDesklets</application> platform,
    as we are having developing it for you!</para>

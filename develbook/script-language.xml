  <title>Scripting Language</title>

  <para>Scripts in <application>gDesklets</application> are written in the
    Python language. By language, we mean the core language, not the rich
    set of modules, which is not available in the sandbox for security
    reasons.</para>

  <para>Python scripts require proper indentation, so the same rule applies to
    scripts on the <application>gDesklets</application> platform. You have to
    take care of consistent indentation within the
    <command>&lt;script&gt;</command> tags.</para>

  <note>
    <para>If you include scripts in your <filename>.display</filename> file,
      you have to make sure that the script doesn't use any characters reserved
      by XML. You can escape them by using the common XML entities, or in case
      of the <command>&lt;script&gt;</command> tag, by putting the script code
      into a CDATA section.</para>

  <title>Versions of gDesklets and Their New Features</title>

  <para>The <application>gDesklets</application> development team has
    attempted to bring new features with every version release. However,
    this has not always been communicated very well to the development
    community on which <application>gDesklets</application> depends for
    useful <literal>Desklets</literal> and <literal>Controls</literal>. The
    following lists attempt to summarize these changes since
    <literal>Controls</literal> came on the scene, before which
    <application>gDesklets</application> isn't supported. This should help
    determine the minimum version of <application>gDesklets</application>
    necessary to support a feature, which is often
    <link linkend="meta-tag">needed for <literal>Desklets</literal></link>.

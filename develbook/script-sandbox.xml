  <title>Sandboxed Execution</title>

  <para>Inline scripts are automatically executed when found in a display.
    Because <application>gDesklets</application> can load displays from remote
    locations as well, special care was taken to protect the user by running
    the code in a sandboxed environment.</para>

  <para>This, however, has the effect that the capabilities of scripting
    code are limited to modifying the elements of the display. There is no
    way to read or modify data on the system.</para>

  <para>If there is need for such actions, you have to use
    <emphasis>controls</emphasis>, which provide a controlled way to access
    data outside the sandbox. The use of controls is explained in
    <link linkend="ctrl">another chapter.</link></para>

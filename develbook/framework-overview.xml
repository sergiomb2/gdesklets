      <para>A daemon is running in the background as a server
        providing a socket for communication. Clients connect to the socket to
        give instructions to the daemon, e.g. to have it open an applet.
      </para>
      <para>The daemon is responsible for loading and running the applets.
        Clients, e.g. a command line frontend, can thus be implemented as thin
        remote controls.
      </para>

    <listitem><para>The user interface of applets, i.e. the things which the
      user will see and be able to interact with, is defined by
      <link linkend="dsp">ADL</link>, a simple, yet powerful XML based language.
      </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>The XML-defined user interface can be brought to life
      with <link linkend="script">inline scripts</link>, i.e. Python scripts
      which are directly written into the XML code or imported there to be
      executed in a <link linkend="script-sandbox">secure sandbox</link>.
      </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Sandboxed scripting code can use
      <link linkend="ctrl">controls</link> to access
      otherwise unreachable data. Controls can, for instance, be used for
      reading hardware information. Basically they provide a controlled way
      to access data outside the sandbox.
      <link linkend="libdesklets"><application>libdesklets</application></link>
      is a library which can be used to ease their implementation.</para>

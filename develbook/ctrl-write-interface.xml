  <title>Writing Interfaces</title>

<section><title>Anatomy of an Interface</title>

  <para>A control interface file is a Python module whose name, by convention,
    starts with an "<filename>I</filename>". The module contains a class of the
    same name without any implementations, deriving from the
    <literal>Interface</literal> base class. It only contains comments and
    declarations of properties.</para>

  <para>The neccessary classes <literal>Interface</literal> and
    <literal>Permission</literal> can both be loaded from
    <literal>libdesklets.controls</literal>:</para>

  <programlisting>
from libdesklets.controls import Interface, Permission
  </programlisting>

</section>



<section id="ctrl-write-interface-declare"><title>Declaring Properties</title>

  <para>A property declaration consist of the property's name along with its
    access permission. The valid permissions are:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><literal>Permission.READ</literal>
      - the property is read-only</listitem>
    <listitem><literal>Permission.WRITE</literal>
      - the property is write-only</listitem>
    <listitem><literal>Permission.READWRITE</literal>
      - the property is readable and writable</listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>A property is declared by assigning the appropriate permission object
    to its name, like this:</para>

  <programlisting>
myproperty = Permission.READWRITE
  </programlisting>

</section>



<section><title>Deriving from Interfaces</title>

  <para>Interfaces can extend other interfaces by deriving from them. A control
    implementing the extended interface automatically implements the original
    interface, too.</para>

  <para>Since interfaces are classes, you just have to load the original class
    and derive from it:</para>

  <programlisting>
from IOriginal1 import IOriginal1
from IOriginal2 import IOriginal2

class IExtended(IOriginal1, IOriginal2):

    ...
  </programlisting>

  <para>It is an error if a property is declared more than once in the
    class hierarchy.</para>

  <para>Please include the original interface files with your control as well,
    since they are required for running the control.</para>

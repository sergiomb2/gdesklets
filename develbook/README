This is the source of the gDesklets Developer's Book.
To build the book, you need xmllint and xsltproc as well as our forked yelp
stylesheets, which are available at <http://www.pycage.de/downloads/yelp-xsl.tar.bz2>.

If necessary, edit make-html.sh to make the XSL variable point to the location of
the stylesheets.


To build the book, run:

  $ ./make-html.sh book.xml output

After that, you will have a directory "output" containing the book.

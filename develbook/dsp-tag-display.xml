  <para>This is the root element of every display file. It represents the
    display window on the screen. Apart from being a toplevel window, it is
    similar to a

    properties.</para>

  <section><title>Window Flags</title>

    <para>Window flags can change the appearance and the behavior of a window.
      The following flags are recognized by
      <application>gDesklets</application>:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><literal>above</literal> - The window appears above all normal
        windows and cannot be lowered.</listitem>
      <listitem><literal>below</literal> - The window appears below all normal
        windows and cannot be raised.</listitem>
      <listitem><literal>decorated</literal> - A decorated window has a titlebar
        and a window frame.</listitem>
      <listitem><literal>managed</literal> - A managed window is controlled by
        the window manager, not by <application>gDesklets</application>.
        </listitem>
      <listitem><literal>sticky</literal> - The window appears on all
        workspaces.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <tip>
      <para>The ideal combination for desktop applets is <literal>sticky,
        below</literal>.</para>

  <section><title>Desktop Borders <emphasis>[new in 0.35]</emphasis></title>

    <para>Desktop borders define areas on the desktop which cannot be covered
      by maximized windows. Panels (i.e. gnome-panel, pypanel) use this 
      feature, for example.</para>
      
    <para>Display windows take two arguments for the border settings. One for
      a horizontal border and one for a vertical border. The values specify the
      distance of the border from the display window. For example, a desklet at
      the bottom edge of the screen with a vertical border value set to
      <literal>0</literal> (i.e. <literal>desktop-borders=",0"</literal> will 
      set a "virtual desktop border" along the desklet's top edge. If the
      desklet, however, is nearer towards the top edge of the screen, the border
      will be along its bottom edge.</para>
      
    <para>When increasing the border value (greater than <literal>0</literal>), 
      the border will be shifted away from the screen's edge by that amount. 
      Negative values pull the border towards the screen's edge. If you unset 
      the value (leave it empty) the border will be turned off.  You can do this
      with the unit constructor <literal>Unit()</literal> in an inline script.
      </para>
      
    <note>
      <para>Desktop borders might by annoying sometimes. So if your desklet supports
        desktop borders, please also provide an option to turn off that behavior!
        </para>

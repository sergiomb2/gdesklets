  <para>This tutorial teaches you how to get started in programming on the
    <application>gDesklets</application> platform. It is an updated and revised
    version of the former HOWTO "How to Make Desklets" by Martin Grimme.</para>

  <section><title>The Parts of a Desklet</title>
    <para>Each desklet consists of a window which contents are defined in a
      <filename>.display</filename> file (which is in plain XML).
      Controls are used to interact with the system.</para>

    <para>You can easily create new desklets without any programming knowledge
      by using existing controls in a new <filename>.display</filename> file.
      The first part of this tutorial will teach you how.</para>

    <para>Now, let's dive into the wonderful world of desklets and
      have fun!</para>
  </section>

<section><title>Part I: Creating .display Files</title>
  
  <section><title>The "Hello World!" Desklet</title>
  
    <para>We will begin with the obligatory
      <emphasize>"Hello World!"</emphasize> desklet, which is very easy with
      <application>gDesklets</application>. Save the
      <filename>.display</filename> file as <filename>hello.display</filename>
      and load it into <application>gDesklets</application>. This is a simple
      static desklet without interaction.</para>
  
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display window-flags="sticky" bg-color="white">
  <label value="Hello, World of Desklets!" font="Serif 20" color="red"/>
</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

    <para>The example uses the two elements <command>&lt;display&gt;</command>
      (the display window) and <command>&lt;label&gt;</command> (a text label).
      Elements can be configured by setting properties on them.
      We want the display to be sticky (visible on all virtual desktops), so
      we set the <property>window-flag</property> to <literal>sticky</literal>.
      You can look up the available properties of each element in the reference
      part of this book.</para>

    <para>Every visual element can be positioned by giving the
      <property>x</property> and <property>y</property> properties. Because
      <literal>0</literal> is the default value for the coordinates, you can
      omit  setting these properties in the label if it should be positioned
      at <literal>(0, 0)</literal>.</para>

  </section>


  <section><title>Grouping of Elements</title>

    <para>If you have already worked with vector based drawing programs, you
      probably know the principle of grouping: several objects behave as if
      they were one object and can be moved around as a whole.
      The <command>&lt;group&gt;</command> container element in
      <application>gDesklets</application> basically does the same.</para>

    <para>Take a look at the following example. It illustrates how to group
      targets together so that they can be positioned as one big object.</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display window-flags="sticky" bg-color="white">
  <label value="#1"/>

  <group x="20" y="20" bg-color="green">
    <label x="0" y="0" value="#2"/>
    <label x="0" y="50" value="#3"/>
    <label x="50" y="0" value="#4"/>
  </group>
</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

    <para>Now play around with the <property>x</property> and
      <property>y</property> coordinate values of the <command>group</command>
      and watch what happens with the labels <literal>#2, #3, #4</literal>.
      </para>

    <para>Some container elements accept only a single child. The
      <command>group</command> counts as a single element, no matter what it
      contains. So it can be used to put complex things into such containers.
      </para>

    <para>As you have already seen, you can set the background of a
      <command>group</command>. You can create empty groups just to make color
      bars. Use the <property>width</property> and <property>height</property>
      properties to set their size, since an empty <command>group</command>
      without a given size will collapse immediately in order to take only as
      much space as its (non-existent) children would need.</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display window-flags="sticky" bg-color="white" width="310" height="20">
  <group bg-color="navy" x="5" y="5" width="300" height="10"/>
</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

  <section><title>Relative Positioning</title>

    <para>Get ready for learning about one of the most powerful positioning
      techniques for display elements:
      <emphasize>relative positioning</emphasize>.</para>

    <para>Until now, you have placed elements by using fixed coordinates. But
      usually you often don't know what the correct coordinate values are.
      Imagine you want to place a percent sign next to a numeric value. The
      value could have one to three digits, so there is no fixed position for
      the percent sign. It should instead be place relative to the position
      of the numeric value. This is where the <property>relative-to</property>
      property comes into play.</para>

    <para>Possible relative positionings are right to the other element, below
      it, or below to the right of it. The appropriate values for
      <property>relative-to</property> are "<literal>id, x</literal>",
      "<literal>id, y</literal>", and "<literal>id, xy</literal>",
      respectively.</para>

    <para>The <property>x</property> and <property>y</property> coordinate
      properties can still be used but are then interpreted as if the origin
      where on the right, left, or bottom edge of the other element,
      respectively.
      Negative values may be used as well for overlapping effects. You can
      use anchors (see XXX) for a finer control of relative positioning.</para>

    <para>Let's take a look at the example with the percent sign to see how it
      is done:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display window-flags="sticky" bg-color="white">
  <label id="fill" value="95" font="Serif 32"/>
  <label relative-to="fill, x" value="%" font="Serif 32"/>
</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

    <para>This looks quite unspectacular, but whenever the width of the numeric
      value label changed, the position of the percent sign would dynamically
      adjust to the right place.</para>

  </section>



  <section><title>Positioning Anchors</title>

    <para>When you set the coordinates of an element, its top left corner will
      usually go to the specified position. This is because the default
      <emphasize>positioning anchor</emphasize> is the top left corner.
      There are nine positioning anchors available in total:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>nw - top left corner</listitem>
      <listitem>n - middle of the top edge</listitem>
      <listitem>ne - top right corner</listitem>
      <listitem>e - middle of the right edge</listitem>
      <listitem>se - bottom right corner</listitem>
      <listitem>s - middle of the bottom edge</listitem>
      <listitem>sw - bottom left corner</listitem>
      <listitem>w - middle of the left edge</listitem>
      <listitem>center - center of the element</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>You can change the positioning anchor by setting the
      <property>anchor</property> to one of the nine values above. The following
      example illustrates the result of each anchor position. The coordinate
      values of all labels are <literal>(50, 50)</literal>, but they all have
      different positions.</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display window-flags="sticky" bg-color="white" width="100" height="100">
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="nw" value="NW" font="Serif 20" color="red"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="n" value="N" font="Serif 20" color="green"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="ne" value="NE" font="Serif 20" color="blue"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="e" value="E" font="Serif 20" color="yellow"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="se" value="SE" font="Serif 20" color="purple"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="s" value="S" font="Serif 20" color="darkred"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="sw" value="SW" font="Serif 20" color="grey70"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="w" value="W" font="Serif 20" color="grey50"/>
  <label x="50" y="50" anchor="center" value="C" font="Serif 20"
         color="black"/>
</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

  <section><title>The Array</title>

    <para>The <command>array</command> is a container elementes, which lets you
      create dynamically growing/shrinking displays like e.g. task bars.
      It consists of a set of similar child elements.</para>

    <para>An <command>array</command> is used like a <command>group</command>
      that can only have one child element (a <command>group</command> with
      several children counts as one element and can of course be used in an
      <command>array</command> container). The following example creates a
      static array of several labels:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display window-flags="sticky" bg-color="#ffffffa0">

  <array layout="vertical" length="10">
    <label value="Text" font="16"/>
  </array>

</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

    <para>By default, an <command>array</command> has no visible children.
      You can set the array length by using the <property>length</property>.
      The <property>layout</property> on the other hand, can be used for
      setting the layout of the child elements in the array, if you don't
      layout them yourself.</para>

    <para>The next example shows you how you can control an
      <command>array</command> with inline scripting.</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<display bg-color="white">

  <array id="myarray" layout="vertical" length="1">
    <label value="Trapped inside an array."/>
  </array>

  <group id="btn1" relative-to="myarray, y" bg-color="grey70"
         on-click="Dsp.myarray.length += 1">
    <label value="Grow"/>
  </group>

  <group relative-to="btn1, x" x="20" bg-color="grey70"
         on-click="if (Dsp.myarray.length != 1): Dsp.myarray.length -= 1">
    <label value="Shrink"/>
  </group>
  
</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

  </section>



  <section><title>Meta Information</title>

    <para>Display files can contain information about themselves and about their
      authors. It is not required to provide such data, but it is
      <emphasize>strongly recommended to do so!</emphasize>
      Applications, like the graphical shell, can parse this data and use it
      to show information about each display file.</para>

    <para>Meta information is stored in the <command>&lt;meta&gt;</command> tag.
      This tag has to be a child of the <command>&lt;display&gt;</command> tag
      and is recognized by <application>gDesklets</application> since version
      0.22. Older versions will complain that the
      <command>&lt;meta&gt;</command> tag is unknown, but otherwise still work.
      </para>

    <para>The <command>&lt;meta&gt;</command> tag accepts a set of attributes
      which describe the display. The following example demonstrates the usage
      of the most common attributes:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<display>
  
  <meta author="A. Nonymous"
        name="Cool Desklet"
        version="1.0"
        description="This is a very cool desklet. ^_^"
        preview="gfx/preview.png"/>

  ...

</display>
    ]]></programlisting>

    <para>The <property>preview</property> attribute is e.g. used by the
      graphical shell to display preview images. You can lookup the valid
      meta attributes in the reference.</para>

This directory contains some basic desklets that should be provided with the gDesklets distribution
so that users can see the system in action without installing additional stuff.

They should be under free software license preferably GNU/GPL version 2 so that other can improve
them and fix the bugs.

Some ideas:

- clock - everybody needs a clock :)
- calendar
- POP/IMAP mail notification - it's so handy
- image - some people like pinning images to their desktops
- sticky notes - you can't live without
- sysinfo (disk, memory/swap, network monitor, ...) not too much. keep it simple! cpu load and memory should be enough for most users
- a template desklet (like sidecandy)
- quote of the day
- ...

Please use this guidelines when creating desklets for this branch:
1. use generic names for desklets (e.g. clock, calendar ...),
2. look at the log file if there are any errors that need to be fixed when desklet is running,
3. create simple icon for desklet (187x161 px),
4. keep preferences simple, use tabs if necessary rather than one big page,
5. discuss the addition in gDesklets-list mailing list (gDesklets-list@gnome.org)
6. adjust the Makefiles according to your changes

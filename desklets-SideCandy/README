Welcome to the desklet-SideCandy branch.
========================================

This branch is a collection of (hopefully) all Desklets in SideCandy style.
The main aim of this collection is to provide a complete set of (SideCandy) themed desklets.
All desklets should all be running without any errors and messages in the logs with the latest version of gDesklets.

These desklets should meet the general standard of the latest version of gDesklets:
- provide all metadata (including a preview)
- provide all files (README and COPYING)
 
Furtheremore these desklets should meet a basic standard for desklets, which include:
- provide a ChangeLog
- have "help" attributes for all elements in the preferences
- use icons for all tabs in the preferences (to be located in gfx/icons)
